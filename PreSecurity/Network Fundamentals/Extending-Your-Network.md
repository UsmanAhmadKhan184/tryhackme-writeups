# Extending Your Network

## Overview
Networks can be expanded beyond a single LAN to allow
communication between multiple networks and locations.

## What I Learned
- Routers connect different networks together
- Switches operate inside a LAN, routers operate between LANs
- The internet is a network of interconnected networks
- NAT (Network Address Translation) allows private IPs to access the internet

## Common Network Types
- **LAN** – Local Area Network
- **WAN** – Wide Area Network
- **MAN** – Metropolitan Area Network
- **VPN** – Secure remote network connection

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Extended networks increase the attack surface.
Understanding network expansion helps in:
- Identifying exposed services
- Securing remote access
- Preventing unauthorized connections

## Key Takeaway
As networks grow, security complexity increases,
making proper configuration and monitoring critical.
