- Internets is worldwide network in which multiple small networks exists
- Devices on a network are identified using IP addresses
- Data is transferred in small units called packets
- Networking enables services like websites, email, and file sharing

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Understanding networking helps attackers and defenders analyze traffic, scan systems, and identify vulnerabilities.

## Key Takeaway
Without networking knowledge, it is impossible to understand how attacks and defenses work.
