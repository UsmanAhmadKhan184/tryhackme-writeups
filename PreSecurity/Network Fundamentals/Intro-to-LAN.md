# Introduction to LAN

## Overview
A Local Area Network (LAN) connects devices within a limited geographical area such as a home, office, or school.

## What I Learned
- LANs are used to connect nearby devices
- Switches are commonly used in LANs to forward traffic
- Devices communicate using MAC addresses at the data link layer
- Routers connect LANs to other networks like the internet

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Most attacks start inside a local network.
Understanding LAN concepts helps in identifying internal threats and misconfigurations.

## Key Takeaway
LAN knowledge is essential for network enumeration and internal penetration testing.
