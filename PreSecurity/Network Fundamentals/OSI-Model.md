# OSI Model

## Overview
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual
framework that explains how data moves from one device to
another across a network using seven layers.

## The 7 OSI Layers
1. **Physical** – Transmits raw bits over physical media (cables, signals)
2. **Data Link** – Handles MAC addresses, frame delivery and error detection
3. **Network** – Responsible for IP addressing and routing
4. **Transport** – Ensures reliable or fast delivery (TCP/UDP)
5. **Session** – Manages sessions between applications
6. **Presentation** – Handles data formatting and encryption
7. **Application** – User-facing services (HTTP, FTP, SMTP)

## What I Learned
- Each layer has a specific role
- Troubleshooting becomes easier using the OSI model

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Understanding OSI layers helps identify where an attack is occurring and which tools or defenses are required.

## Key Takeaway
The OSI model is the foundation for networking, security analysis, and penetration testing.
