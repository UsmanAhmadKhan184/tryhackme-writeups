# Putting It All Together

## Overview
This section connects all the networking concepts
learned throughout the Network Fundamentals module.

## How Everything Connects
- Devices communicate using **networks**
- Data moves using **packets and frames**
- Communication follows the **OSI model**
- DNS translates domain names into IP addresses
- HTTP/HTTPS enable web communication
- Websites rely on client-server architecture

## What I Learned
- Networking concepts work together, not separately
- Attacks target weaknesses across multiple layers
- Understanding data flow improves attack and defense strategies

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Real-world attacks involve multiple technologies.
Knowing how everything fits together helps in:
- Network enumeration
- Traffic analysis
- Vulnerability exploitation
- Incident response

## Key Takeaway
Strong fundamentals allow cybersecurity professionals
to understand, exploit, and defend systems effectively.
