# How Websites Work

## Overview
Websites are built using multiple technologies that
work together to deliver content to users through
web browsers.

## Components of a Website
- **Frontend** – What users see (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Backend** – Server-side logic (databases, APIs)
- **Web Server** – Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests

## Request-Response Cycle
1. User enters a URL
2. DNS resolves the domain to an IP address
3. Browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request
4. Server processes the request
5. Response is returned to the browser

## What I Learned
- Websites rely on client-server architecture
- User input is processed by backend systems
- Poor input handling leads to vulnerabilities

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Understanding how websites work helps identify:
- Injection flaws
- Authentication issues
- Access control problems

## Key Takeaway
Knowing website architecture is essential
for discovering and exploiting web vulnerabilities.
