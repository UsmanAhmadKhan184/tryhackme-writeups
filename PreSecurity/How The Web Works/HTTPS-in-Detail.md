# HTTPS in Detail

## Overview
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure
version of HTTP that encrypts data using SSL/TLS to
protect communication between clients and servers.

## How HTTPS Works
1. Client connects to a server using HTTPS
2. Server sends its SSL/TLS certificate
3. Client verifies the certificate
4. Encrypted communication begins

## SSL/TLS Certificates
- Issued by Certificate Authorities (CA)
- Verify server identity
- Enable encrypted communication

## What I Learned
- HTTPS prevents data interception
- Encryption protects sensitive information
- Certificates ensure server authenticity

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
HTTPS protects against:
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
- Data tampering
- Credential theft

However, misconfigurations can still be exploited.

## Key Takeaway
HTTPS improves security but must be correctly
implemented to fully protect web traffic.
