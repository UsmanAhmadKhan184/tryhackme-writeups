# HTTP in Detail

## Overview
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used for communication
between web clients and servers. It defines how requests and
responses are formatted and transmitted.

## How HTTP Works
1. Client sends an HTTP request
2. Server processes the request
3. Server sends an HTTP response
4. Connection may be closed or kept alive

## Common HTTP Methods
- **GET** – Retrieve data from server
- **POST** – Send data to server
- **PUT** – Update existing data
- **DELETE** – Remove data

## HTTP Status Codes
- **200** – OK
- **201** – Created
- **301** – Moved Permanently
- **302** – Found
- **400** – Bad Request
- **401** – Not Authorized
- **403** – Forbidden
- **404** – Page Not Found
- **405** – Method Not Allowed
- **500** – Internal Server Error
- **503** – Service Unavailable

## What I Learned
- HTTP is stateless
- Headers control behavior and security
- Data can be intercepted and modified

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Most web attacks target HTTP traffic.
Understanding HTTP helps exploit and secure
web applications.

## Key Takeaway
HTTP knowledge is essential for web penetration
testing and vulnerability discovery.
