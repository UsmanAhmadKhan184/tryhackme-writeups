# Offensive Security Intro

## What I Learned
- Offensive security focuses on simulating real-world attacks
- Hands-on practice is performed in controlled lab(fakebank.thm) environment of TryHackMe
- Red Team carries out ethical hacking with proper authorization

## Why This Matters
Offensive security forms the foundation of penetration testing
and helps identify vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.
