# Linux File System Explained

## Overview
Linux uses a hierarchical file system where all files
and directories start from the root directory `/`.

## Important Directories
- `/` – Root directory, starting point of the file system
- `/home` – User home directories
- `/root` – Home directory of the root user
- `/bin` – Essential user commands
- `/sbin` – System administration commands
- `/etc` – Configuration files
- `/var` – Logs and variable data
- `/tmp` – Temporary files
- `/usr` – User applications and utilities
- `/opt` – Optional software packages

## What I Learned
- Everything in Linux is treated as a file
- Permissions control access to files and directories
- Knowing directory structure helps locate configs and logs

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
- Sensitive data is often stored in predictable locations
- Logs help detect attacks
- Misconfigured files can lead to privilege escalation

## Key Takeaway
Understanding the Linux file system is critical
for navigation, exploitation, and defense.
